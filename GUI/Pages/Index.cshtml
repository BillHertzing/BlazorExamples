<h1> Blazor served by ServiceStack in a Console App </h1>

<p>Welcome to a simple demonstration of a Blazor Application served from a ServiceStack Console App</p>

<p>Having Fiddler installed and running is good idea to see the network interaction between the Blazor app and the ServiceStack App</p>

<p>Navigate to the BasicRESTService page to cause this Blazor App to send an Initialization Post to the ServiceStack Console App</p>

<p>Enter data in the "Data To Post" field, press the "Post Data" button, and see ServiceStack echo back the data you entered</p>
