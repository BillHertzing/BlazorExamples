# Getting started with the Blazor - ServiceStack Demos
The projects in this Repository/solution demonstrate how to use Blazor with ServiceStack as the static site server.

Under the folder `demos` are individual demonstration subfolders

Under the folder `AutoDoc` is a project that uses DocFx, an experimental static documentation site generator, to create the documentation you are reading.

The SolutionDocumentation subfolder has additional documentation that applies to the entire repository.

## Getting the Demo projects
This repository is not yet sophisticated enough to create a zip with binaries and be able to safely secure and deliver that.
Besides, building these demos from source is probably the best way to understand what's going on.

1. Fork the repository and attach your Visual Studio Source Code Control provider to the fork [Instructions for Forking a repository](), [Instructions for attaching Visual Studio to a GitHub repository]().

## Building the Demo projects
1. Tell Visual Studio to not build the documentation project, as it will take quite a bit of time, and is not needed to run the demos. [Instructions for configuring the solution so that the documentation is not built.()
1. Build the entire solution in the Debug configuration.
1. Go into each individual Demo, and "Publish" the GUI. [Instructions on what "Publish" will do] ()
