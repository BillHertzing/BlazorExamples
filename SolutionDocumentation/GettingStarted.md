# Getting tarted with the Blazor - ServiceStack Demos
The projects in thei Repository/solution demonstrate howto use Blazor with ServiceStack as the static site server.

This repository is not yet sophisticated enough o create a zip with binaries and be able to safely secure that. Instead, only building from source code is supported.

1, Fork the repository and attach your Visual Studio Source Code Control provider to the fork
2. Tell Visual Studio to not build the documentation project.
