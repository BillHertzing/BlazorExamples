# Static Documentation website hosted by GitHub pages
The static documentation site has been created with [DocFx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/). It has been organized with information common to all the demos in one section, [Repository-wide](/Articles/index.md), and individual demo documentation in a separate section for each demo [Demo-Specific](/Articles/Demos/index.md).
