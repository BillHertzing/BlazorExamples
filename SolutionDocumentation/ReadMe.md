## Directory.Build.props
Welcome to the home page for the documentation on my GitHub Blazor Examples repository. 
This is an Open Source Software (OSS) MIT-licensed repository with code samples and documentation that illustrates how I am using [Blazor](https://github.com/aspnet/Blazor) with [ServiceStack](https://servicestack.net/), AKA SS.

# Static Documentation website hosted by GitHub pages
The static documentation site has been created with [DocFx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/). It has been organized with information common to all the demos in one section, [Repository-wide](/Articles/index.md), and individual demo documentation in a separate section for each demo [Demo-Specific](/Articles/Demos/index.md).
