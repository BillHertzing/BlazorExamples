# Getting Started with the AutoDoc project

The AutoDoc project is one way to create a static website that contains documentation for a Git repository. Itworks by searching the repository for ..csproj files, and creating API documentation from /// "Triple-Slash" comments in the text file, and combining that API documentation with content from .md files in the repository.

AutoDoc uses the DocFx (https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) OpenSource project from Microsoft as the engine for creating the  website.

AutoDoc is part of the ATAP Utilities repository.

I am actively developing this documentation static website, and publishing to the ATAP Utilities GitHub Pages host. Over the course of the next few weeks, the site will be in a constant state of flux, but hopefully will settle down after the automation tools are completed and content is written.
