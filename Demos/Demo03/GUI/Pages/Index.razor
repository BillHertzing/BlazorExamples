<h1>A Blazor GUI served by ServiceStack Middleware in a .Net Core 2.2 Kestrel WebHost.</h1>
<p>The server in this demo uses a TargetFramework: Net Core 2.2 and a WebHost: Kestrel</p>

<h2>Demo's point</h2>
<p>To demonstrate Blazor storing data in the browser local storage, and a synchronous event handler to increment that variable</p>
<h3>GUI changes</h3>
<p>This demo implements storing data in the browser local storage to persist the value of the Property on this page.</p>
<h3>Server changes</h3>
<p></p>
<h3>.sccs changes</h3>
<p>The site.sccs file appears, the site.css files is migrated to site.sccs,</p>
<h2>Developer tools</h2>
<p>The build process is exteded with Web Compiler to produce site.css from site.scss</p>
<h2>Visual portion</h2>
<p>The number below is stored in a page-local Property named AnIntegerProperty. The number will increment with each button click. The Property value is written to browser-local storage each time the setter is run. The Property value is read from  browser-local storage via the getter. Each time the page is initialized, the initialization logic will check the browser-local storage for the last stored value, and will set the property to that last stored value. Refreshing the page will <strong>NOT</strong> reset the value to 0 if the property is present in the browser-storage, However, if you clear the browser-local storage, then refresh the page, the property will go back to 0. Unless browser-local storage is cleared, the value of `AnIntegerProperty`, when a page is initialized for the first time, will be the value stored in browser-local storage. This means the last value will persist when the application is subsequently loaded, because browser-local storage is persistent.</p>

<p>AnIntegerProperty backed by Blazored.Localstorage: @AnIntegerProperty</p>
<button name="IncrementAnIntegerProperty" class="btn btn-primary" @onclick="@IncrementAnIntegerPropertyButtonOnClick">click to increment</button>
