<h1>Blazor served by a GenericHost </h1>
<ul>ServiceStack middleware app</ul>
<ul>Hosted within a Kestrel WebServer</ul>
<ul><bold>without</bold> IIS integration</ul>
<ul>Running under ASP.NET CORE V3.0 Preview 5</ul>

<p>Having Fiddler installed and running is good idea to see the network interaction between the Blazor app and the Kestrel WebServer hosting the ServiceStack app.</p>

<p>The logging for the client side of this demo is configured to send debugging messages to the browser's Console window</p>
<p>Having the browser's "Developer tools" window open, showing the browser Console window, will display the logging messages that originate from the GUI code</p>
<p>Note that the Browser's Console Window will display log message "by default" only in Firefox and Edge; Chrome, by default, requires a setting change to be able to display the Console log messages </p>

<p>The logging for the server side of this demo is configured to send debugging messages to the Console Window opened by the GenericHost (when running as a Console App)</p>

<p>Run this command in a powershell window: ps | ?{$_.name -match "iis"}, and you will NOT see iis listed</p>

<p>Navigate to the BasicRESTServices page to cause this Blazor app to send an Initialization Post to the ServiceStack app.</p>

<p>Enter data in the "Data To Post" field, press the "Post Data" button, and see (in Fiddler and on the screen) ServiceStack echo back the data you entered.</p>
